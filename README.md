## Water Quality Arduino Project

Hi there!

This repository is for a project for a Massey University course to measure water quality in a lake. As of now the Arduino project has been completed with several measurements taken, and a Java-based viewer has been created to process the results with a GUI. I intend to make further refinements to the Java code.
