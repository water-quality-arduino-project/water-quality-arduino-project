## Water Quality Arduino Project

Hi there!

This repository is for a project for a Massey University course to measure water quality in a lake. This project is still a WIP but will have two pieces of code: one which runs on an Arduino-based sensor machine and saves water quality data to a file, and then a Java-based app which will read the data gathered by the machine.

I intend to complete the Arduino code and commence measurements in September, after which the Java code will be worked on.
